# ðŸª™ Payroll application ðŸª™

## Before you start:
- Communication with docker is handled by Makefile
- Docker configuration was tested on windows with wsl and mac
- If you need to generate app compatible id use `make identifier`


## Starting app:
1. Execute `make setup`

## Functionalities:

Default host for local environment is `localhost`

### Generating new payroll report
Endpoint: `POST /payroll-report/generate`

Endpoint returns generated report `id` to be used in next functionality.
### Viewing payroll report
Endpoint: `GET /payroll-report/{id}/rows`

Can be sorted using query param in format `?sort[sortName]=sortDirection`.

Available sort names are:
- name
- surname
- department
- remunerationBase
- additionToBase
- bonusType
- salaryWithBonus

Available sort directions are:
- asc
- desc

Can be filtered using query param in format `?filterName=filterValue`.

Available filter names are:

## Entering database:
Database details are:

Host: `localhost`\
Port: `3306`\
User: `root`\
Password: `rootpassword`\
Database: `payroll`\
Database type: `mariadb 10.5.5`

## Design assumptions:
- Departments, employees and bonuses can be added by making direct inserts into database
- Request can only use one sort at a time
- Request can use many filters at a time
